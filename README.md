# 🌱 Fertilizer Recommendation System  

This repository contains my project for the **Shell–Edunet Skills4Future AICTE Internship** under the **Sustainable Agriculture** domain.  
The goal is to apply **Machine Learning** techniques to recommend the most suitable fertilizer for a given crop, supporting **sustainable farming practices**.  

---

## 📌 Project Title  
**Fertilizer Recommendation System**  

---

## 🎯 Objective  
The aim of this project is to build a system that recommends the right fertilizer for crops based on soil and environmental conditions.  
By doing so, the project contributes to:  
- 🌾 Optimized fertilizer usage  
- 🌻 Improved crop yield  
- 🌍 Reduced environmental impact  
- 🚜 Sustainable and eco-friendly farming practices  

---

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle:  

👉 [Crop and Fertilizer Dataset for Western Maharashtra](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanchitagholap/crop-fertilizer-dataset-for-western-maharashtra](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanchitagholap/crop-and-fertilizer-dataset-for-westernmaharashtra))  

It contains information about crops, soil nutrients (NPK), pH, rainfall, temperature, and fertilizer recommendations.
